** Content/Structure

   HTML
   'It is not a programming language, but rather a language that
   identifies the meaning, purpose, and structure of text within
   a document.' [[https://html.com/html5/#ixzz6FBt3HtF4][Read more]]

*** history

**** 1989 An Idea

     - Tim Berners-Lee has an idea to help researchers collaborate

       - Regardless of location

       - by linking documents together by some form of 'hypertext'.

**** 1990 HTML Specification

     - Tim Berners-Lee writes the specification, the browser and
       server software.

     - creates HTTP for retrieving documents via hyperlinks

       - Only 'GET' at this point, and it can only return HTML

     - He decides to base HTML on an already internationally agreed
       upon standard called the Standard Generalized Mark-up
       Language (SGML).

       - He adds the 'a' (anchor tag) to the existing elements with the HREF attribute to implement the hypertext link.

**** 1991 HTML 1

     - First public mention of HTML

       - originally consisted of 18 tags defined [[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html][here]]

**** 1994 - 95 HTML 2.0

     - In response to New browsers adding custom tags of there own
       a new specification is born.

       - based on all the most popular new tags

       - A new Doctype Definition (DTD)

**** 2014 HTML 5

     - No longer based on SGML

     - Semantic (meaningful) mark-up

     - Separation of design from content

     - Promoting accessibility and design responsiveness

     - Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

     - Supporting rich media experiences while eliminating the need
       for plugins such as Flash or Java

*** responsibility

    - content
    - connecting documents across the web
    - embedding media
    - orchestrating the inclusion of CSS and JS

**** why

     Although it is possible to embed the styles in-line, the page
     becomes harder to maintain. Although maintainability is an
     important concern, there are other considerations to
     separate responsibilities (e.g. content and presentation).
     Users view web content in a lot of different contexts —
     desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, RSS readers, and
     many others. Styles and design decisions that make sense in
     one environment don't always make sense in another. So it is
     much better to provide semantic information and let the content
     be adapted to the context.

*** Security concerns

    - Not validating user input
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
      - reflected
      - persistent
    - SQL injection
    - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    - Clickjacking
    - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security][Others...]]

*** best practices

    - use semantic mark-up

    - don't use [[https://html.com/deprecated/][these deprecated features]] and [[https://rules.sonarsource.com/html/tag/html5/RSPEC-1827][these]]

    - don't use inline styles

    - use kebob-case or snake_case for class/id names.

      - one or the other, please be consistent

    - use lowercase kebob-case for tag names.

      - it helps keep things readable

    - Use alt attribute with images

*** Search Engine Optimization considerations

    - Use a title

    - Header tags help and give an implicit ranking to your page

    - Use a meta description in the head

** Presentation

   'CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
   including colors, layout, and fonts... The separation of HTML from
   CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across
   pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is
   referred to as the separation of structure (or: content)
   from presentation.' [[https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss.html][W3C - HTML & CSS]]

**** 1994

     - Håkon Wium Lie released the first draft of “Cascading HTML
       Style Sheets” in October at a web conference in Chicago
       (Developer's Day)
       - The concept of a balance between author and user preferences
       - CSS was perceived by some as being too simple for the task
	 it was designed for. They argued that in order to style
	 documents, the power of a full programming language was
	 needed. CSS went in the exact opposite direction by making
	 a point out of being a simple, declarative format.

**** 1995

     - HTML3.2 includes the font tag
     - WWW conference in April 1995, CSS was again presented
       - Bert Bos presented the support for style sheets in Argo
       - Håkon showed a version of the Arena browser which had been
	 modified to support CSS
	 - Arena was written by Dave Ragett as a testbed.
     - The presentations became a political argument
       - Author :: the author ultimately had to be in charge of
	 deciding how documents were presented. (e.g. legal reasons)
       - User :: Whose eyes and ears ultimately have to decode the
	 presentation, should be given the last word when there are
	 conflicts.

**** 1996 CSS Recommendation released

     - Microsoft Internet Explorer became the first browser to
       support CSS.
       - reliably supports most of the color, background, font and
	 text properties, but does not implement much of the
	 box model.

**** 1998 CSS 2

     - then CSS 2.1 fixing the buggy nature of its predecessor
       has capabilities that allows the user to design page layout.

**** 1999 CSS 3

     - Allows The User To Create Presentations From Documents And
       to select from a wider range of fonts including those from
       Google and Typecast. Uniquely, CSS3 allows the user to
       incorporate rounded borders and use multiple columns. CSS3
       is considered to be easier to use (when compared to CSS2)
       because it has different modules

**** 2011

     CSS 2.1 finally being published as an official WC3
     recommendation
