** HTML

   /It is not a programming language, but rather a language that
   identifies the meaning, purpose, and structure of text within
   a document./ [[https://html.com/html5/#ixzz6FBt3HtF4][Read more]]

*** history

**** 1989 An Idea

     - Tim Berners-Lee has an idea to help researchers collaborate

       - Regardless of location

       - by linking documents together by some form of 'hypertext'.

**** 1990 HTML Specification

     - Tim Berners-Lee writes the specification, the browser and
       server software.

     - creates HTTP for retrieving documents via hyperlinks

       - Only 'GET' at this point, and it can only return HTML

     - He decides to base HTML on an already internationally agreed
       upon standard called the Standard Generalized Mark-up
       Language (SGML).

       - He adds the 'a' (anchor tag) to the existing elements with the HREF attribute to implement the hypertext link.

**** 1991 HTML 1

     - First public mention of HTML

       - originally consisted of 18 tags defined [[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html][here]]

**** 1994 - 95 HTML 2.0

     - In response to New browsers adding custom tags of there own
       a new specification is born.

       - based on all the most popular new tags

       - A new Doctype Definition (DTD)

**** 2014 HTML 5

     - No longer based on SGML

       - no longer needs a DTD

*** responsibility

    - content
    - connecting documents across the web
    - embedding media
    - orchestrating the inclusion of CSS and JS

**** why

     Although it is possible to embed the styles in-line, the page
     becomes harder to maintain. Although maintainability is an
     important concern, there are other considerations to
     separate responsibilities (e.g. content and presentation).

*** Security concerns

    - Not validating user input
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
      - reflected
      - persistent
    - SQL injection
    - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    - Clickjacking
